# Basic Game Dice
## Instructor Notes


### 0. Instructor Prep List
Read through the code and make sure the `main.py` file executes without error.

### 1. Engage Classroom
Personalize the experience by asking the group what games they like to play that involve dice. Suggest that they could implement many of those games with some fairly simple code. At the least, they could implement the dice portion of the game. And that's what we're doing today!

    return random.randint(1, sides)


def dice(rolls: int, sides: int) -> int:
    return sum(d(sides) for _ in range(rolls))

```
